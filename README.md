## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vanilla JavaScript]

### What I learned

This was the first time I'll use 'target' and 'currentTarget' in a project. It was really tricky at first but I'm starting to get the hang of it.

### Continued development

I hope to build more projects using the DOM.
