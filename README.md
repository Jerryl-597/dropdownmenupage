## My process

### What I learned
 - The website has a sidebar, a modal overlay and transition to improve the user experience. The website is also responsive in different mobile screens (320px, 375px, 425px, 768px). 
 - The dropdown buttons are dynamic and was built with JavaScript.
This was the first time I'll use 'target' and 'currentTarget' in a project. It was really tricky at first but I'm starting to get the hang of it.

### Continued development

I hope to build more projects using the DOM.
